DESCRIPTION: This file makes the function call to the primary function in ebtel_functions.c.
It first defines some basic parameters of the EBTEL model including the input parameters as well
as the constants used throughout. Following the necessary function call, it saves the data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EBTEL (Enthalpy Based Thermal Evolution of Loops) computes 0-D
hydrodynamic equations.  This software was originally developed by Klimchuk et al,. (2008) and
later improved upon by Cargill et al., (2012a,b). It solves the set of hydrostatic equations by 
averaging over the loop half-length and then integrating in time. Additional details are available
in the two references given above.

Note on variable correspondence with Klimchuk et al. (2008)
   r1 = c_3
   r2 = c_2
   r3 = c_1
   f, ff = F_0
   f_eq, ff_eq = - R_tr
   dem_eq = DEM_se

INTENSITIES:
   For observations in which temperature response function, G(T), has units of 
   DN s^-1 pix^-1 cm^5 and the loop diameter, d, is larger than the pixel dimension, l_pix:

      I_cor_perp = d/(2L)* Int{G(T)*dem_cor(T)*dT}
      I_tr_perp = d/l_pix * Int{G(T)*dem_tr(T)*dT}
      I_tr_parallel = Int{G(T)*dem_tr(T)*dT} ,

   for lines-of-sight perpendicular and parallel to the loop axis.  I_tr_perp assumes that 
   the transition region is thinner than l_pix.

MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
   Runs much more quickly if the transition region DEM is not computed.
   Speed can be increased by increasing the minimum DEM temperature from 10^4 to, say, 10^5 K 
      or by decreasing the maximum DEM temperature from 10^8.5 to, say, 10^7.5 
      (search on 450 and 451).
   The equilibrium base heat flux coefficient of 2/7 is appropriate for uniform heating;
      a coefficient of 4/7 is more appropriate for apex heating.
   To have equal amounts of thermal and nonthermal heating:  flux_nt = heat*length.
   It is desirable to have a low-level background heating during the cooling phase so that the 
      coronal temperature does not drop below values at which the corona DEM is invalid.
   r1 = c_3 = 0.7 gives more accurate coronal evolution than the original 0.5, especially in 
      the late phase of cooling.  However, it produces excess DEM at the very hottest temperatures 
      during impulsive events, and the transition region DEM is somewhat elevated.  We have 
      therefore introduced r1_tr = 0.5, which provides a more accurate transition region DEM at 
      the same time that r1 = 0.7 provides a more accurate radiative cooling.
   v = (c_3/c_2)*(t_tr/t)*v_0 = (r1/r2)*(t_tr/t)*(v/r4) at temperature t_tr in the transition 
      region, where t is the average coronal temperature.

USAGE:
(set in usage field of opt parameter structure. See input list above.
(1)--include transition region DEM
     additional outputs: dem_tr, dem_cor, logtdem
(2)--exclude transition region DEM (faster)
(3)--include nonthermal electron energy flux
     additional inputs: flux_nt, energy_nt
(4)--compute rad_ratio (25% more computing time)
     additional outputs: dem_tr, dem_cor, logtdem, f_ratio, rad_ratio
